  <div>The visual and UI's for all the displays in the system were designed with a minimalist approach so that all graphic elements
    on screen direct the users attention towards the essential elements.  <br></div>
    <br>
  <div>Every added element on screen competes for the userâ€™s attention and memory, therefore through progressive disclosure and careful
    design choices our aim was to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio that represents only the necessary functionality that the 
    user might need in that instance.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Elements:
  <ul>
  <li>Every UI in the system is designed in an unclustered manner with essential elements being depicted at the center of the screen. </li>
  <li>The navigation icons and buttons adhere to conventional standards and appear in the corners of the screen or towards the center as an overlay indicating a specific functionality that the system offers at the time.</li>
  <li>There are no redundant or non-functional graphic elements on screen at any time that try to compete for the users attention.</li>
  </ul>
