  <li>As designers we have strived to make the UI as intuitive as possible. However in spite of that it is possible at times users may need assistance while using the system.
  </li>
  <li>To accommodate for that we built into the system a landing page for each game so that users can familiarize themselves with the controls and difficulty settings before starting the games.
  </li>
  <li>Every game landing page has:</li>
  <ul>Instructions - That are specific to the game and come with audio and visual aids to improve accessibility for all potential users
  </ul>
  <ul>Difficulty - So that users can personally alter the game mechanics to their own preference by selecting a difficulty level</ul>
