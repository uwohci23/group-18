    This Heuristic deals with making sure that for whatever errors may occur they are properly recognized and diagnosed, as well as helping the user be able to recover from these errors
  </p>
  <p>
    In our system we made an effort to prevent many errors from occurring in the first place. 
    Because of this there are not many errors for the user to trigger internally within our system due to our many constraints. 
  </p>
  <p>
    An error that can occur from the user that we have dealt with however is the error of submitting a score to the leaderboard without a name. 
    When this error occurs a JavaScript alert is sent to the user which states: 
  </p>
  <p>
    “You cannot submit a score with no name. Please use the text area below to enter a name to go with your score!”
  </p>
  <p>
    By this response we have clearly informed the user that there was an issue, told them what was wrong, and then offered them the solution to fixing the problem.
