    The system remains consistent both internally and externally. Formatting and color choices are very similar between the 
    different screens of the application. For semiotics, we chose conventionally used icons that are instantly recognizable. 
    Furthermore, the game controls follow the standard for their respective genres. These choices allow the user to transfer 
    their knowledge from previous digital experiences. That being said, the internal consistency could be further improved
    by making the gameplay canvases more similar to one another in terms of color schemes, sizing and positioning.
