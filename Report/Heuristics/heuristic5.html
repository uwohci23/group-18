  <div>For a smoother and seamless experience our system is designed to promote user recognition over recall.<br></div>
    <br>
  <div>The key difference between recognition and recall is the number of cues provided. Because recall has fewer cues it is more
    likely to be error prone. Thus design choices made for this system support user recognition by providing adequete prompts for
    users to recognize.

    Elements:
  <ul>
  <li>Graphic elements within each of the game while updated still retain certain iconic elements such as the canvas for minesweeper,
    the body of the snake - which help users recognize and refamliarize themselves with the corresponding game mechanics.</li>
  <li>Within each of the games the highest score in the chosen difficulty is always on display for the user to see thereby reducing their
    cognitive load and having to switch back and forth between displays to see what scores to beat.
