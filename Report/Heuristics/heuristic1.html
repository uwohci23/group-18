    The state of the system is provided to the user with both persistent elements and feedback.
    Actions have clear and distinct reactions, allowing the player to understand what is happening and why.
    Visibility could be further improved by adding more animations to game events, for example when a block 
    is stored within Tetris, or when a bomb explodes in Minesweeper.

  <div> Persistent elements:
    <ul>
      <li>Current score/time is always displayed within each game and is updated when appropriate. 
        The player can therefore evaluate their performance and understand the effect of their actions within the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div> Feedback:
    <ul>
      <li>Buttons provide feedback in the form of animations and color changes.
        Navigating through seperate menus and pages is therefore intuitive and happens instantly.</li>
      <li>The current state of user selection is clear. Currently selected difficulty is highlighted 
        within each game screen, and currently displayed high scores are distinguished with a unique color.</li>
      <li>For Tetris customization, there are response messages indicated that block color choices were successfully updated.</li>
      <li>Using game controls have an instant effect within the game area (snake moves, flags are placed, blocks rotate etc.)</li>
    </ul>
