    <div>As designers we have strived to make the UI as intuitive as possible. However there can still be times where the users 
    may need help or are unfamiliar with the mechanics or game controls.<br></div>
  
    <div>To accommodate for such situations we have implemented a landing page/game specific menus in the system so that users 
      can familiarize themselves with all the relevant information pertaining to that specific game. There they have access to the 
      instructions and difficulty settings.

      Elements:
    <li>Instructions - Which describe to the user the objective of the game, how to play it and the controls for navigation.</li>
    <li>Difficulty Settings - So that users can select a more suitable difficulty level.</li>
    </div>
