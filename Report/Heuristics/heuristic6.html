  <div>Keeping this in mind certain design changes were made within the system in each of the games. By adding difficulty settings 
    (Easy/Medium/Hard) users get to select their preferred means of interaction with each of the games and controls were also updated 
    to allow more than one kind of input. Improved flexibility also allows greater efficiency in the system.

    Elements:
  <ul>
  <li>Allowing users to select their preferred means of interaction by selecting a difficulty and altering the game mechanics
    provides greater flexibilty in each of the games.</li>
  <li>Updating the game controls from the regular arrow keys to also include control with WASD keys makes the system a lot more intuitive
    and familiar to avid pc/desktop gamers.
  </li>
  <li>As a result the overall system becomes a lot more flexible as it can be friendly and easy for first-time users and gradually get 
    a lot more challenging for experienced and veteran users.
