  <p>With this heuristic users should not feel in any way trapped by the computer/system or have any hesitation about 
    accidentally initiating an unwanted process and having no way of exiting it.
  </p>

  <p>In our system we have successfully demonstrated the implementation of this heuristic throughout our interface. 
    Throughout the menus we are consistently providing the users with very recognizable and consistent “back” buttons that allow users to go back to the main menu. 
    With this the user does not have to fear accidentally clicking the wrong game as they will confidently be able to exit and go back to the main menu.
  </p>

    We also implement clearly labelled exit functionality with an ‘X’ for our pop-up menus (instructions for all, customization for Tetris) within each of the game menus.
