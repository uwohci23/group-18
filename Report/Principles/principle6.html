        <li><b>Confirmations: </b><br>To minimize errors of irrevocable operations the sysetm shows pop-ups to confirm with the user when 
          they are switching between displays. Before exiting to the main menu or stopping the current game 
          to restart the system prompts for the user to confirm their choice.</li>
        <li><b>Semiotics: </b><br>Using iconic signs(mute, settings etc.)to create a system that work all together to help with correct 
          interpretation by users. This also aligns with the pictorial superiority to represent certain functionality within the system.</li>
        <li><b>Constraints: </b><br>To preserve your session and any progress you made in the game the user cannot interact with the background 
          once the game has been paused or an overlay is active. Similarly a few constraints are also placed for the submissions of highscores 
          to prevent any errors. You are only prompted to save a highscore if you are in the top 10 and the name must not be empty. Until a 
          name is submitted the other buttons remained greyed out so the user doesn't accidentally lose their highscore by a misclick.</li>
