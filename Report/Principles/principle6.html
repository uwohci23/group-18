        <li><b>Confirmations: </b><br>To minimize errors of irrevocable operations the sysetm shows pop-ups to confirm with the user when 
          they are switching between displays. Before exiting to the main menu or stopping the current game 
          to restart the system prompts for the user to confirm their choice.</li>

        <li><b>Constraints: </b><br>To preserve your session and any progress you made in the game the user cannot interact with the background 
          or play games once an overlay is active or the game has been paused. Similarly a few constraints are also 
          present for the submissions of highscores and leaderboards to prevent any errors. You are only prompted to 
          save a highscore if you are in the top 10 and the name must not be empty. Until a name is submitted the other
          buttons remained greyed out so the user doesn't accidentally lose their highscore by a misclick.</li>
