    <h1>Providing users with an immediate response when an action is completed and to bridge the gulf 
        of evaluation the system uses multiple types of feedback. In the leaderboard when an option is 
        selected- a game or a difficulty, it gets highlighted. In game menus once the button is clicked
        it changes colour to indicate the selection. Within the game snake, whenever an action is 
        completed the user gets audio feedback.
