        <li><b>80/20 Principle: </b><br>To maintain a more simple and streamlined design a good portion of user choice is 
        hidden in the customization menu, so users can focus on the more important selections (Difficulty) which will actually 
        affect the game. </li>
        <li><b>Gestalt Laws of Grouping: </b><br>Within the customization menu similar elements are grouped together, background elements 
        are grouped separately from the Tetris blocks.</li>
        <li><b>Progressive Disclosure: </b><br>While customizing the full colour selection tool only shows up when needed so that the 
        screen is not crowded or overwhelming to the user. </li>
        <li><b>Causality: </b><br>Users can immediately identify the cause and effect when changes are made while customizing. Users
        can see the changes made to the colour of an element right away in the selection block.</li>
