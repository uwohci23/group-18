        <li><b>Consistency: </b><br>To provide the user with a sense of familiarity and uniform consistency throughout the system we 
          expressed all similar components such as navigation icons, game menus and buttons with consistent layouts and the same 
          functionality across the entire wesbite.</li>
        <li><b>Control: </b><br>To enhace control within the system and allow users to tailor the experience according to their 
          preferences we have given the users the option to select different difficulty settings to alter the game mechanics. For 
          improved accessibility for all potential user's, there is a text-to-speech option for instructions so users can determine
          how they would like to access that information.</li>
        <li><b>Chunking: </b><br>Within each of the game specific menus all the required instructions that the user might need to recall 
          or managing the game difficulty is all grouped together in that interface so that it can be easily processed and remembered by
          anyone that encounters it.</li>
