        <li><b>Consistency: </b><br>To provide the user with a sense of familiarity and uniform consistency throughout the system we expressed 
          all similar components such as navigation icons, game menus and buttons with consistent layouts and the same 
          functionality across the entire wesbite.</li>
        <li><b>Control: </b><br>To enhace control within the system and allow users to tailor the experience according to their 
          preferences we have given the users the option to select different difficulty settings to alter 
          the game mechanics. To build on familiarity and accessibility the games can be played with either 
          standard arrow keys and the 'WASD' keys.</li>
        <li><b>Semiotics: </b><br>Using iconic signs(mute, settings etc.)to create a system that work all together to help with correct 
          interpretation by users. This also aligns with the pictorial superiority to represent certain functionality.</li>
