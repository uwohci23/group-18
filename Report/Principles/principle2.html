    <h1>To preserve your session and any progress you made in the game the user cannot interact with the background 
        or play games once an overlay is active or the game has been paused. Similarly a few constraints are also 
        present for the submissions of highscores and leaderboards to prevent any errors. You are only prompted to 
        save a highscore if you are in the top 10 and the name must not be empty. Until a name is submitted the other
        buttons remained greyed out so the user doesn't accidentally lose their highscore by a misclick.
