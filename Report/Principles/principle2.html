        <li><b>Visibility: </b><br>While looking up highscores or browsing through the leaderboard only the top 10 scores are displayed
        to avoid cluttering the UI. Though the system keeps track of all highscores for each game at every difficulty level, it only displays
        the relevant and necessary information according to the userâ€™s selection.</li>
        <li><b>Working Memory Principle: </b><br>Similar to the top score to beat in an arcade game, the system shows the highest score from each
        game while playing. This reduces the cognitive load and makes it easier for users to glance at the information instead of having to recall.</li>
        <li><b>Mapping: </b><br>Inside the leaderboard each of the game and difficulty maps to its own table. Thanks to the affordance 
        of the buttons, when the user makes their selections the buttons remain highlighted indicating the selection. The user can easily
        view the resulting table that appears as a result of their choice.</li>
