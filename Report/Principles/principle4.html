          <li><b>Familiarity: </b><br>Both games have been visually updated but maintain a sense of familiarity by using newer but 
          similar graphic elements to other arcade games. To further enhance familiarity the system maintains the same game-specific 
          controls so that games can be played with standard arrow keys or the 'WASD' keys.</li>
          <li><b>Feedback: </b><br>Providing users with an immediate response when an action is completed to bridge the gulf of 
          evaluation the system uses multiple types of feedback.  Within snake, whenever an action is completed(Eat/Crash/Move) the 
          user gets audio feedback. In the leaderboard when an option is selected it gets highlighted. In game menus once the button 
          is clicked it changes colour to indicate the user's choice.</li>
          <li><b>Transfer: </b><br>To take advantage of the user's previous understanding of artifacts and situations, the system design 
          implements conventional layout of buttons with standard navigational icons (pause/back etc) to induce positive transfer. 
          </li>
          <li><b>Hick's Law: </b><br>The virtual arcade system is built with 3 games with 3 different settings with customizibility options 
          so that users can enjoy a fast and seamless gaming experience. Instead of overwhelming the users with a multitude of options and 
          fostering indecisiveness, our system is developed with a consistent theme so that users can decisively pick and play their favourite
          game in this virtual arcade.
